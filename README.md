# Rental-systemPython project - Library Management System 

This project majorly focus on Object-Oriented_Programming(OOP). We created a library where student/anyone borrow books, return books, donate books to library and track all books which are taken by students/anyone.A library management system is used to maintain library records. It tracks the records of the books in the library, what  books are issued, or what books have been returned.
A library management system's goal is to instantly and accurately provide information about any type of book, saving a great deal of time and effort.

## The Library Management System will have the following listed features:
    
Listing All Books
1. Borrow Book: The user can borrow any available book.
2. Return Book: The user can return any issued book and see if any fine is applicable.
3. Donate Books: The User Can donate any Books he wanted to donate.
4. Track Books: The User can track all the issued books.
5. Exit the library: Exit the program.
