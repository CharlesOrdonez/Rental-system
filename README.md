# Rental-systemPython project - Library Management System 

This project majorly focus on Object-Oriented_Programming(OOP). We created a library where student/anyone borrow books, return books, donate books to library and track all books which are taken by students/anyone.

## The Library Management System will have the following listed features:
    
Listing All Books
Borrow Book: The user can borrow any available book.
Return Book: The user can return any issued book and see if any fine is applicable.
Donate Books: The User Can donate any Books he wanted to donate.
Track Books: The User can track all the issued books.
Exit the library: Exit the program.
